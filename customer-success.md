Since Adaâ€™s product enables teams to create an automated support experience, itâ€™s crucial that your activity as a Customer Success Manager be exemplary, serving as the gold standard for both our customers and product team. 
 
An important activity you will be performing at Ada is building the initial bot experiences for our new customers based on their existing support articles. 
 
Your challenge is to create a bot for the education-technology company [Top Hat](https://tophat.com) that provides a warm greeting and helps users who are struggling to enrol in a course, purchase a subscription, and reset their password. The support article which provides the solutions to each of these issues is attached in _Materials_ below. 

Make sure to read about the qualities of a successful bot in the _Materials_ below. When you are finished, please send us the link to your bot for feedback.
